# Amply-Project
Amply is the name of our Early Childhod Development project that measures the attendance of children at early learning centers.  The project was build as a MVP to test concepts that are now being used to construct the ixo Protocol.

The Amply application currently stores attendance records as impact data in a privately run Ethereum network. The system is live at 72 Early Learning Centers in South Africa and over 42 000 attendance records have be recorded to date.

The code and repositories for this application are all open-source and can be found here: [Amply Project](https://github.com/TrustlabTech)
